                Place steak in a large resealable bag; add 1 clove minced garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper.

                When the grill is preheated, cook steak to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). 
                Let stand for 5 minutes before thinly slicing across the grain.

                Divide steak and tomato mixture evenly between the salads.
