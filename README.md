This project creates a basic website that contains several relative links to a few recipes. The aim of this project is to practice HTML fundamentals, including creating the initial HTML structure, using basic HTML tags within the body such as ```<p>``` and ```<h1>```, adding links, adding images, resizing images, using lists (unordered and ordered), using the command line for moving and adding files, directories, and images, and using the command line for git workflow, which includes using commands such as git add, git commit (and using an editor), git log (or shortlog), and git status.
